# MC883-Hands-On-Network
Repository for experiment with C language web sockets for TCP and UDP protocols

# How to run
To test the code in yout machine all you need to do is:
```BASH
sh build.sh
```
and then run the server and the client in two consoles (both running at the same time of course) with the following commands:
```BASH
sh server.sh
```
```BASH
sh client.sh
```
If your computer does not support BASH scripts please just open the `.sh` files in the root of this project and copy paste the code in your terminal with the needed changes.
